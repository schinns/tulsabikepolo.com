Tulsa Bike Polo Club (TBPC) welcomes everyone and aspires to create diverse,
inclusive, and supportive spaces. Whether at the court, on our social media, at club sponsored
events, or elsewhere – the following apply:
* No member shall engage in any conduct, act towards, or speak to or of any other person
in a manner which offends, insults, humiliates or vilifies such person on the basis of
gender identity, sexual preference, race, religion, descent, ethnic origin, or ability.
* Members are expected to conduct themselves in a manner that will enhance the
reputation of TBPC and bike polo in general, both on and off the court.
* Members will avoid engaging in any form of conduct or behavior detrimental to the spirit
of the game as well as treat other players, spectators, and property respectfully.
* No intimidation or abusive language or behavior will be tolerated on or off the court.
### Safer Spaces Guidelines
* Respect people’s background and identities, including their names and pronouns.
* Be thoughtful about the language you use.
* If you believe someone has violated our CoC, feel free to speak up and/or inform a club
member.
* Allow others to call you in if they believe you may have acted in violation.
* Allow others to represent and speak for themselves – never ask or expect someone to
speak on behalf of others.
* Let others learn at their own pace and ask before giving advice.
### Accountability Process
TBPC encourages individuals to resolve conflict amongst themselves by privately giving
constructive, respectful feedback if it feels safe to do so. All members shall focus on receiving
feedback in a manner that seeks to understand, collaborate, and implement a solution.

Another club member may occasionally be asked to act as a conflict mediator between two or
more parties. A mediator’s role is to be objective/impartial, focused on enhancing respectful
language, and suggesting possible solutions. The conflict mediator should not be the go-to
person at every instance.

All members shall hold themselves accountable for adhering to and promoting the CoC in a
manner that is proactive and intentional. If members find themselves unable to do so, they may
be subject to ejection from a game or suspension at the discretion of the club majority.
