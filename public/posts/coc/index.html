    </header><p>Tulsa Bike Polo Club (TBPC) welcomes everyone and aspires to create diverse,
inclusive, and supportive spaces. Whether at the court, on our social media, at club sponsored
events, or elsewhere – the following apply:</p>
<ul>
<li>No member shall engage in any conduct, act towards, or speak to or of any other person
in a manner which offends, insults, humiliates or vilifies such person on the basis of
gender identity, sexual preference, race, religion, descent, ethnic origin, or ability.</li>
<li>Members are expected to conduct themselves in a manner that will enhance the
reputation of TBPC and bike polo in general, both on and off the court.</li>
<li>Members will avoid engaging in any form of conduct or behavior detrimental to the spirit
of the game as well as treat other players, spectators, and property respectfully.</li>
<li>No intimidation or abusive language or behavior will be tolerated on or off the court.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="safer-spaces-guidelines">Safer Spaces Guidelines</h3>
<ul>
<li>Respect people’s background and identities, including their names and pronouns.</li>
<li>Be thoughtful about the language you use.</li>
<li>If you believe someone has violated our COC, feel free to speak up and/or inform a club
member.</li>
<li>Allow others to call you in if they believe you may have acted in violation.</li>
<li>Allow others to represent and speak for themselves – never ask or expect someone to
speak on behalf of others.</li>
<li>Let others learn at their own pace and ask before giving advice.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="accountability-process">Accountability Process</h3>
<p>TBPC encourages individuals to resolve conflict amongst themselves by privately giving
constructive, respectful feedback if it feels safe to do so. All members shall focus on receiving
feedback in a manner that seeks to understand, collaborate, and implement a solution.</p>
<p>Another club member may occasionally be asked to act as a conflict mediator between two or
more parties. A mediator’s role is to be objective/impartial, focused on enhancing respectful
language, and suggesting possible solutions. The conflict mediator should not be the go-to
person at every instance.</p>
<p>All members shall hold themselves accountable for adhering to and promoting the CoC in a
manner that is proactive and intentional. If members find themselves unable to do so, they may
be subject to ejection from a game or suspension at the discretion of the club majority.</p>
